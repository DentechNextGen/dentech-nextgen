## Chart pre-existing conditionals and treatment plans with ease.

Keep track of treatment proposals and completed work.
You can also select defaults for various treatments, either manually or by voice. For example, whenever a crown is charted you can have “gold” automatically selected and change if needed.

## Treatment and Insurance Plans

See which teeth have proposed treatments or scheduled procedures. Treatment Plan View helps your patients understand out-of-pocket vs. insurance costs for each potential treatment. Plus, you can switch to “teeth view” to show patients tooth image graphics, allowing you to further illustrate treatment options.
