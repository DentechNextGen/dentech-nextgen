Dentech has added the XDR Radiology line of digital imaging solutions, consisting of Size 1 and Size 2 intraoral sensors and digital imaging software technology to their product offerings. Qualification testing on all Dentech software solutions has proven that the sensors and imaging software provide consistent, high-quality digital imaging at a fraction of the cost of competitive imaging solutions.

“Continuing Dentech’s proud tradition of privately-owned companies, our partnership with XDR Radiology is an ideal choice for our customer base, said Jane E. Kaminski Dentech’s Chief Operating Officer. We are beyond impressed with the level of deep knowledge and expertise of the entire team at XDR Radiology and the precision and perfection they have placed into their sensors and imaging software. It is clear to us that XDR Radiology takes immense pride in their product portfolio, and we are excited to be able to deliver such an exceptional product to the industry.”
