After countless hours of development, testing, and feedback from its consumers, Dentech’s new website and logo presents a fresh new look and feel. Some of the new Dentech website’s features include:

- Interactive forms, such as Purchase Inquiries, Demo Requests, and Software Enhancement Requests, which streamlines communication with the end-user.

- Onsite Live Remote Assistance. This feature gives the Dentech Support Team the ability to remotely access your computer to solve issues without you ever having to click off of Dentech to a 3rd party site.

- Online product and solution catalogs make purchasing from Dentech and browsing their selection of products and solutions much simpler. This website is a one stop shop for important product information.

- Overhauled user interface which drastically improves user experience and provides an easy-to-use platform for anyone visiting www.dentech.com.

“We are extremely pleased and excited to be able to announce the rebranding of Dentech and our new website. This change has been long-awaited and we are so happy now that the branding of our company reflects the modernity and inventiveness of the products and solutions we offer,” remarked Jane E. Kaminski, Chief Operating Officer of Softech, Inc. “This is the change our customers have been waiting for and a change that is necessary to demonstrate who we are to potential clients as well. We know our users will enjoy the new site as we utilize it as a platform to introduce our future innovations to the entire dental market.”
