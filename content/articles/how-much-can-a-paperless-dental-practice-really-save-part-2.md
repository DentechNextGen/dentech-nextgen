# Employee Time is Money!

With a large number of paper files to go through, your team spends way more time filing and organizing documents than helping your practice grow. A paper document practice can spend more than 3 hours a week just filing and sifting through paper. In the United States, the average office manager’s salary range is around $40 an hour. That’s over $6200 a year going into simply sorting paper. That’s valuable time and money that can be spent doing what your office managers do best – helping your practice operate more efficiently!

# Upgrading to a Paperless Software Solution

Upgrading to a paperless software solution reduces time wasted for your employees in several ways. Not only does it save time from filling out paper forms, but it also saves time from organizing files. With your files sorted automatically in easily searchable ways, spending time to look for something is a thing of the past.
