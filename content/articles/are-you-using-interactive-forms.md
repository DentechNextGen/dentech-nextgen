desc: Interactive forms can help your practice capture and organize patient information. Handwriting can often make answers illegible, sometimes questions get skipped and even inputting data into your system can lead to mistakes.

Your practice can create forms that are completely customized to your practice and then patients can fill them out digitally and even sign electronically.

A typical interactive form consists of various filled types in which text can be typed or check boxes selected.

Since the forms are interactive, and stored within the DenDox system, anyone with a PDF reader can view the forms. Interactive forms within DenDox also have version control, so at any time the Providers can go back and review the very first form filled and signed by the patient.
