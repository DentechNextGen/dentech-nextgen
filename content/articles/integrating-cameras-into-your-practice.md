## A Plan for Integrating Intraoral Cameras and Optimizing Your Return on Investment

Purchasing a high quality intraoral camera is proven to produce a return on your investment in 1 to 3 months depending on how well and often you use the equipment. Below is a simple plan to follow to help make your transition to digital imaging a worthwhile investment.

## Develop a Plan

Developing a thorough plan for any investment and equipment implementation is the key to success. Too often we believe that just purchasing the product will yield results. Just like any business, the key to success is in the processes that are implemented and truly practiced by its employees.

In terms of your practice and digital cameras it is important to think through how you, your hygienists and dental assistants will use a camera. Will it be used for every patient? Who in the office will be trained and allowed to use the camera? How will the images be stored? Will you purchase more than one camera? Know who will be using the cameras and ensure they are trained.

## Incorporate Cameras into Your Daily Patient Treatment Routine

Avoid only using the camera on some patients and not on others. This will result in inconsistent patient treatment and incomplete patient charts. Make sure that the camera is easily accessible. For example, the Iris Intraoral Camera by DigitalDoc fits perfectly into standard delivery tray slots making the camera just as easy to reach as your maintenance scaler. When your camera is easily accessible you will be more likely to use it each and every time.

## Results
