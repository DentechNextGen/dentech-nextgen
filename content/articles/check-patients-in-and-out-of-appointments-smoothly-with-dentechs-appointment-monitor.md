The appointment monitor feature in Dentech helps tie your appointment scheduler and Check-Me-In kiosk together for a scheduling power combo that will make your patient appointment flow much more efficient!

## Your clinic’s appointments for the day — In one intuitive interface!

Our Appointment Monitor interface keeps you informed before your patients arrive in your waiting room. Your scheduled appointments automatically populate in the Appointment Monitor for the day, in one fully integrated process. Update each appointment status as your patients come in without having to navigate to a different page, and have all the information you need about your patient available to you right at your fingertips.

Have our patient Check-Me-In kiosk? Your patients’ appointment statuses are automatically updated as they check themselves in. They are doing your work for you!

The new Dentech has everything you need to keep all your patient appointments organized for the entire day. With our new Appointment Monitor interface, you can minimize your appointment processing and focus more time on taking care of your patients.

We are booked for demos up until December, and I’m thrilled with your excitement! Schedule your demo session and see the new Dentech for yourself.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Jane E. Kaminski
