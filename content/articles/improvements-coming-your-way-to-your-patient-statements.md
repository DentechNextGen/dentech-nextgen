Dear Valued Dentech Customer,

Dentech is excited to announce that we are making improvements to your statement processing experience. On February 1, 2021 we will be transitioning to a new statement processor, MailMyStatements. This change will bring you an overall enhanced statement process, look and experience.

What upgrades can I expect?

1. Your own customer portal to manage and monitor your statements

2. Option to print or email statements to patients

3. New updated statement layout designs that allow you to match your statements to your brand!

When does this happen?

This switch occurs February 1, 2021. We will send you reminder emails about the switch as the date draws closer to make sure you can get the maximum benefits for your practice!

What do you need to do?

If you are currently submitting statements directly through Dentech we will be reaching out to you to schedule a one on one overview for managing your customer portal. Please note that the process of submitting statements through Dentech will still remain the same.

﻿If you are not submitting statements through Dentech, give us a call and we will be more than happy to work with you to bring a more streamlined approach to your practice.

﻿Thank you for your continued business and we look forward to offering you a more improved patient statement experience. For further questions, please contact support@dentech.com or call 866-549-8702.

Thank you,

Jane E. Kaminski

Chief Operating Officer
