# Financial Reports
These reports provide information on your clinic’s **financial performance**, including **revenue**, **expenses**, and **profitability**. You can use these reports to track your clinic’s financial health, identify areas for improvement, and make informed business decisions.

A **payor A/R report** can provide a number of important pieces of information about a dental practice’s financial status, including:
- The total amount of money that the practice is owed by **payors**.
- The amount of money that is **overdue**, or past due.
- The average length of time it takes for the practice to receive payment from payors.
- The **percentage of total A/R** that is overdue.
- The number of claims that have been submitted to payors but have not yet been paid.
By reviewing a payor A/R report, your dental practice can identify any issues that may be causing **delays in payment** and take steps to resolve them.

By running a **production report**, you can identify trends in the types of services that are being provided to your patients and the associated revenue generated. This can help you identify areas where the practice is doing well and areas where it may be able to improve. For example, if a lot of **revenue** is generated from **preventative services**, you may want to focus on promoting these services to your patients. On the other hand, if your practice is not generating much revenue from a particular category of services, you may want to consider whether you are offering the right mix of services to meet the needs of your **patient demographics**.

An **incomplete work report** is a report that lists all of the treatments or procedures that have been started but not yet completed at your dental practice. This report can provide important information about the **efficiency** and **productivity** of the practice by helping you identify any bottlenecks or delays in the treatment process so you can take steps to address them. It also monitors the progress of treatment for individual patients and ensures that they are receiving **timely care**.
