The Exam Focus Window (EFW) provides the detailed view and working environment for the Restorative examination. All examination operations are available, so the Mouse, Voice and Keyboard can all be used to perform the examination via the EFW for the Pre-Existing Treatment and Conditions, Treatment Plan, and Completed Work entry. The Exam Focus Window (EFW) is visible from a 6 foot span. This allows the user to enter everything from one focal point, no need for extra mouse clicks.
