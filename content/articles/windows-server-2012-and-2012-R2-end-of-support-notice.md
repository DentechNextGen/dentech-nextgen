## Summary

To summarize, **Windows Server 2012** and **Windows Server 2012 R2** will end on October 10, 2023. The process of acquiring new equipment, updating your system, transferring data, and conducting thorough testing can take up to 6-8 weeks. If you desire to schedule some installation work during a period when the practice is closed, it may take even longer.

## I Need To Upgrade…What Can I Do?

To ensure that your practice continues operating without interruption and remains in compliance with **HIPAA**, we strongly recommend scheduling the replacement or upgrade of any workstations running on **Windows Server 2012** or **2012 R2** no later than August 2023.

If you’ve already upgraded from **Windows Server 2012** and **2012 R2**, you will not be affected by Microsoft ending support for these operating systems. If you’re unsure about the operating system installed on your workstations, schedule a consult with our team to see what your upgrade options are **TODAY**! We’re here to help you navigate this transition smoothly.
