Our brand new Treatment Planning feature makes it easy to create and make changes to your patient’s treatment plans whenever you need to. Our new interface shows everything you need on one accessible page:

- Easily keep track of Accepted, In Progress or Rejected Treatment Plans
- Add Presenter and Patient Comments
- More detailed patient insurance information with write-off amounts
- Ability to phase treatment plans between appointments
- Easily edit tooth # and surfaces

# Treatment Planning Interface

Create multiple plans at one time, and print on the spot treatment acceptance forms whenever you need them. Completed treatments are automatically archived so you can view a patient’s past treatments to cross-reference at any time.

Knowing what is covered by a patient’s insurance won’t be so complicated anymore! View multiple insurances at one time with our new “Preview Splits” feature, giving you less margin for error that might cost you time and effort to correct later.

See for yourself how the new Dentech makes treatment planning and insurance processing a breeze for you. Join me for a one-on-one demo session. Sign up today!

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Jane E. Kaminski

Chief Operating Officer
