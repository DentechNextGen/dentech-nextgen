Missed appointments aren't just empty slots in your schedule; they're a drain on your revenue, a disruptor to your well-planned workflow, and a missed opportunity for patient care. Imagine a practice where these frustrations are minimized, your schedule is optimized, and your team is empowered. Dentech's sophisticated suite of tools for managing failed and canceled appointments can turn this vision into your daily reality. Let's explore how you can transform your appointment management and boost your practice's performance.

## Understanding Dentech's Terminology

To leverage these powerful features, let's clarify our approach:

- **Failed Appointment**: Dentech intelligently identifies a "failed" appointment when a patient is on the books but no procedures are logged in Charge Entry for that day – proactively flagging potential no-shows.

- **Canceled Appointment**: This tracks any appointment proactively canceled using Dentech's streamlined cancel feature within the appointment scheduling system, keeping your records accurate and up-to-date.

## The Failed Appointment Report

The Failed Appointment Report is more than just a list; it's your strategic tool for gaining clarity on attendance and taking action as a business.

### Unlock Key Advantages & Features:

- **Instant Identification**: At a glance, see a comprehensive list of all patients who missed their appointments within any timeframe you define, allowing you to follow up promptly.

- **Seamless Automation Trigger**: This isn't just a report; it's the engine for Dentech's automated failed appointment tracking. Activate this in your Office Standards, and patients on this report can automatically have the "FAILD" procedure code applied in Charge Entry – saving manual effort and ensuring consistency.

### Generating Your Report:

1. Launch the Appointment Scheduling program (accessible from the Dentech Main Menu or your toolbar).
2. Navigate to the Reports drop-down menu.
3. Select Failed Appointments.
4. In the "Failed Appointments" window, customize your view:
   - **Start Date & End Date**: Pinpoint the exact period you want to analyze (MMDDYY format).
   - **Print Only Newly Failed?**: Opt for an update on appointments that have failed since your last report, or get a complete overview.
   - **Patient Messages & Account Messages**: Include relevant communications for a fuller picture. Important !Alert! messages are always included, ensuring you don't miss critical information.
5. Click OK – and let Dentech do the work!
6. Choose to generate the report in the background (Yes is typically best) to keep your workflow uninterrupted.
7. Access your "Failed Appointment Report" via the Dentech Print Manager to view, print, or manage.

### Deciphering Your Report for Maximum Impact:

The report delivers crucial data for each failed appointment: Patient Name, Patient Number, Provider, Appointment Type, Date, Time, Appointment Length, and all necessary patient contact numbers. Plus, a running total of failed appointments gives you an immediate understanding of the scale.

**A Vital Note for Automated Efficiency**: If automatic failed appointment tracking is enabled, the "FAILD" code will be applied to every patient on this report. This is a powerful time-saver!

## Setting Up Automatic Tracking

Imagine your system proactively managing canceled and failed appointments. Dentech makes it possible!

### 1. ADA Procedure Codes:

![ADA Procedure Codes Setup](/blogs/images/failed-appointments/ada-codes.png)

1. Head to the ADA Procedure Codes Maintenance program.
2. Establish a dedicated reporting category for Canceled and Failed appointments.
3. Implement two key codes:
   - **CANCL**: To track Canceled Appointments.
   - **FAILD**: To track Failed Appointments.

**Pro Tip**: Link these to your new reporting category. Crucially, leave the ADA field blank for these codes to prevent any accidental updates to a patient's last visit date.

Want to keep statements clean? Simply uncheck the "Statement" field for these codes.

**Essential for Automation**: For the system to work its magic, CANCL and FAILD must be these exact codes.

### 2. Optimize Your Appointment Scheduling / Office Standards:

1. Access Office Standards via the Maintenance menu in Appointment Scheduling.
2. Fine-tune your automation:
   - **Create Cancellation Record**: Activate this, and Dentech will automatically tally patient cancellations. This valuable data appears on the daily log, patient treatment record, and account ledger, offering insights into patient behavior.
   - **Create Failed Appt Record**: Similarly, enable this to automatically track failed appointments, with counts visible in the same key areas.
   - **Months to Show Count**: Define how long you want to accumulate these totals, aligning with your practice's data retention policies (always check your Office Configuration).
3. Click Save and feel the power of automation!

## Witness Automatic Tracking in Action: Effortless Management

With setup complete, experience the ease:

### Canceled Appointment Tracking:

1. Simply open the appointment to be canceled in Appointment Scheduling.
2. A quick double-click brings up the appointment options.
3. Select Cancel Appointment.
4. Confirm with a Yes.
5. Instantly, Dentech adds a "CANCL" charge in Charge Entry. You maintain full control – this can be removed before posting if needed.

### Failed Appointment Tracking:

1. Run your Failed Appointment Report.
2. For every patient listed, Dentech automatically logs a "FAILD" charge in Charge Entry, dated to the actual day of the missed appointment. Again, this can be adjusted prior to posting.

## Stay Informed: Viewing and Managing Records with Ease

### Quickly Check Canceled/Failed Counts for Any Patient:

3. Instantly see the patient's history of failed and canceled appointments on the right-hand side – perfect for informed conversations.

### Need to Adjust a Record? Simple Deletion:

1. Before posting, access the patient's record in Charge Entry.
2. The "CANCL" or "FAILD" code will be clearly visible.
3. Easily remove the procedure using the standard Delete function in Charge Entry.

## Elevate Your Communication & Internal Notes

Dentech also helps you refine how you document appointment changes:

### Streamline with Cancel/Schedule Codes:

![Cancel Codes Configuration](/blogs/images/failed-appointments/cancel-codes.png)

1. Create custom shorthand codes (up to 3 characters) for your most common appointment or cancellation notes.
2. Find this under Appointment Scheduling > Maintenance > Cancel/Schedule Codes.
3. Assign each code as a "Cancel Type" or "Schedule Type" and write your full standard remark (up to 40 characters).
4. These concise notes will populate the Patient Appointment Window and Cancellation report, ensuring clarity and consistency.

### Clarify with Confirmation Codes:

1. Develop 1-character alpha codes for standard confirmation remarks.
2. Set these up in Appointment Scheduling > Maintenance > Confirmation Codes.
3. Define the full remark (up to 30 characters) for each code.
4. These codes enhance both the Patient Appointment Window and the Cancellation report.
