While we continue to work behind the scenes on improving the look and functionality of our software…We’re also growing the Dentech community.

Based on our customer’s feedback from my previous emails I’d like to invite you to join in on the conversations in two ways:

We’ve made a feedback forum for those who like that style: https://dentech.freeforums.net/
If you prefer the social media route, we’ve put together a Facebook group as well: https://web.facebook.com/groups/309210266870061
You can also find a link to our feedback forum and Facebook group on our website under “Resources”. We look forward to watching the communities grow with

users like you who have helped shape Dentech and we want to keep that tradition alive.

With all that will be happening going into 2021, this is your chance to play a huge part in what happens.

I can’t wait to see what we can create together!

Sincerely,

Jane Kaminski

PS – I’m also looking for moderators. If you have Facebook group or forum experience, I’d love to chat with you about helping moderate these groups. If you are interested…hit that reply button!
