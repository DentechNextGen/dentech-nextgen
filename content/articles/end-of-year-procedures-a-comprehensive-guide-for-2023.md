**DISCLAIMER**: Certain recommended end of year procedures and reports may be different depending on the version of Dentech the practice is running.

## Important Reminder: Backup Your Data

Before diving into the year-end procedures, it’s crucial to make sure you have a valid backup of all your data. Don’t skip this step, as it ensures the safety and security of your records.

### 1. Posting Procedures

After all activity for 2023 has been entered, ensure to run **POSTING** manually.

- **Key Point**: Avoid waiting until January 2024 to post. To guarantee that posting takes place in 2023, refrain from running posting via the Job Scheduler.

### 2. Resetting Insurance Maximums

This procedure should be executed after all 2023 activities have been inputted and before starting any entries for 2024.

- Reset Maximums from 12/31/2023 to 01/31/2024.
- If the Reset Maximum is scheduled in the Job Scheduler, confirm that it’s set to activate on January 1st, 2024.
- Reset the Patient/Dr. Referral Period? Answer “yes” if you want the system to zero out the count for Patient and Doctor referrals. This will allow the system to begin counting the referrals again starting January 1st. The count of “Total Referrals” is not affected.
- End of Year? Answering “yes” tells the system that all of the financial transactions have been posted. What this does: In Patient Registration any amounts accumulated for this year's “Year to Date” totals will be moved to the “Last Year” column. **DO NOT** answer “yes” to this question more than once or you will lose your figures! When the question comes up again at the end of January, answer “no”.

### 3. Month-End Generation

Conclude the **MONTH END** process after completing the aforementioned steps.

- Provide the following input: Month: 12, Year: 2023, Pay Class Data: Y.
- If **MONTH END** is set to be automated in the Job Scheduler, ensure it’s set to run on January 1st, 2024.

### 4. Generating and Printing Reports

If your accountant requires Account Receivable reports, produce them before making entries for 2024.

- Priority reports to consider are Producer A/R, Daysheet A/R, Aged Accounts Receivable, and Payor A/R.
- Any other Dentech reports can be fetched whenever necessary.

## Final Step: Backup Your Data Again

Ensure the safety of your records by creating another backup after you’ve finished the year-end procedures.
