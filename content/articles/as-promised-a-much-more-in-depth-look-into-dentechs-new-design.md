For this month I would like to talk about the next step in our design process, the top navigation bar: Every step of the patient process laid out in a logical sequence, making your day to day tasks easier to manage then ever before. Simply hover over an icon and a sub menu drops down for access to more detailed patient management items.

In the over 40 years of doing business, we have learned that each practice generally processes patients in the same order: 

1. Patient Registration
2. Appointment Scheduling and Management
3. Chart Conditions
4. Treatment Plan
5. Charge Out Services
6. Manage Financials
7. Manage Insurance Claims

In our navigation bar, we follow the same process, laid out in an intuitive and logical order, left to right. You’ll notice the same buttons you’ve come to know and love, now with updated icons that are gentle on the eyes making screen navigation easier than ever before (a topic of serious debate in the Dentech family)! We have enhanced your search capabilities by including a new patient search field to help you quickly switch between patients in a fraction of the time. 

While the top navigation will always be present, the Patient Information Bar will dynamically change based on what patient you are working on. Easy patient info, always present, no matter where you are:

Wrapping up our navigation mapping is our left menu bar, which holds all the information you are familiar with in an easy to navigate slide out menu. We even included a menu search field to assist our users in those “need to find now” moments.

We know that the combination of our quick step navigation and Patient Information Bar will empower you with all the information you need to do your job quickly, in a logical workflow. By following this workflow, we have found that customers save on average 23% more time in processing patient information.

Functionality aside, our brand is becoming much more streamlined with a modern design. I am confident that our look and feel will match our software’s maturity and experience for decades to come! If you have any feedback about our new navigation or questions about our design process, simply reply to this email or give me a call. Thank you for being part of this journey!
