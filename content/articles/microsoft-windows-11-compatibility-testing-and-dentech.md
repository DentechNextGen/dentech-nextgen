Our testing is vital to keeping your digital dentistry solutions running smoothly. As a valued Dentech customer, we want to ensure that you are unaffected if and when you update to Windows 11.

We recommend that at this moment, you wait to upgrade to Windows 11 until we have completed testing so we can ensure the stability of your system. We will get back to you shortly once we have confirmed the compatibility between software.

Microsoft will continue to support Windows 10 until at least 2025.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to send us a message here.

Sincerely,

Jane E. Kaminski
Chief Operating Officer
