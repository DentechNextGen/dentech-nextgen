For the Medical Alerts to appear, make sure you enter all Medical Alerts in Patient Registration under the information tab of Dentech.

Medical Alerts will automatically pop-up when DenChart first opens. You have to close the box to continue.

Once in DenChart, the Medical Alerts will always be visible in the Patient Information bar.

If you want to turn the Medical Alerts off, that can be achieved in the Office Configuration Tab under View.
