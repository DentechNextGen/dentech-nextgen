desc: Welcoming first-time patients to your practice and widening your referral network is a great way to fill up a schedule, but one of the hallmarks of a great practice is the retention of the patients you already have! It’s unavoidable to have a few missed appointments here and there, however, these can quickly add up to a significant chunk of lost revenue each year. So what can we do to keep our chairs full and current patients on track? In this three-part series, we’re going to take a look at how improving patient engagement and communication can address the three most common causes of patient no-shows – and how Dentech can help!

# Automate Appointment Reminders

This may seem like a no-brainer, but around half of your missed appointments can be attributed to patients simply forgetting the day of. It’s easy for an appointment to slip through the cracks when it’s been booked weeks or months ahead of time, or when multiple appointments are booked at once.

One of the best ways to approach appointment reminders is by providing clients with instant, engaging communication options that go beyond a regular phone call. The Dentech Communicator is the perfect tool for this! It allows you to automate appointment or reminders that can be sent by SMS or email, regardless of office hours or busy phone lines. A wide array of templates also takes the guesswork out of drafting messages, with plenty of options to add your own branding!
