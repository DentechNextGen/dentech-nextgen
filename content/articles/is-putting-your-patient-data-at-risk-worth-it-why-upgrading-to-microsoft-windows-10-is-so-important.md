## Are you still one of the 39%?

There are reasons for this and reasons to be concerned about if we as users care about the security of our data. If Microsoft is taking this seriously, then we need to take a cue from them and listen.

In actuality, Microsoft ended all mainstream support and warranty for Windows 7 on January 13, 2015 and has only been providing security and bug fixes. Granted you will not wake up on January 14, 2020 to find that your Windows 7 pc has spontaneously combusted. You will still be able to use it, however, there are strong concerns and urges from every angle of the software and technology world that warns us otherwise.

## Are we over exaggerating? No, and here is why.

Microsoft will no longer provide patches for viruses or security issues once Windows 7 reaches End of Life. This leaves you as an end user extremely vulnerable to cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Moreover, if a large percentage of users are still using Windows 7, malicious targeting by deviant individuals is greatly increased as they look to target those that are most vulnerable.

## Why leave patient data at such a high risk when it’s so easy to update?

There is minimal disruption and down time when upgrading your Windows software to Windows 10 and most software applications are already compatible with Windows 10. For the most part, upgrading to Windows 10 does not require new hardware as long as your hardware meets the minimum specifications.

## Why is it important to invest in updating to Windows 10?

It’s simple, you are either paying to update to Windows 10 or spending a substantial amount of money to clean up a cyber attack that has compromised your patient data and placed you in violation of HIPAA. Is the risk truly worth it? I think not and many would agree.
