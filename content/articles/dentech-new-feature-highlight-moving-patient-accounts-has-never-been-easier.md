desc: Today, I would like to introduce two new features that many of our voice of customer participants have been very excited about. Relationships are ever-evolving, and sometimes that means patient accounts need to move around. Transferring patient accounts between families has been a somewhat complex process in the past.

With our up-and-coming new Dentech you can now quickly move a patient account to a different family or start a brand new account for a patient with a simple click of a button. Dentech does the work for you.  Check out our explanation below:

Dentech has always strived to be not only powerful in our feature sets, but helpful as well. As we push into the next generation of Dentech this concept of helpfulness has taken a top priority. In the end, the more efficient we can make our software, the more time your practice saves entering data, allowing you to get back to what you do best: improving patient’s dental health.

Our goal is to help your practice succeed, which means recognizing that the people who know Dentech’s products best are our customers. If you have other ideas on how we can continue to make Dentech more helpful, please send me an enhancement request!

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Jane E. Kaminski
Chief Operating Officer
