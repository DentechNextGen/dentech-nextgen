# Happier Patients = More Savings?

According to a survey done by the Manifest in 2018, only 13% of people prefer using physical forms, whether completed in person or by mail. Since the rapid digitization of 2020, that percentage has only decreased. Proper patient retention is the best way to save (and make!) money for your practice, with a 25% decrease in cost compared to patient recruitment. So, in a way, choosing the options that make your current patients happier **DOES** save you money!

Today, there’s also a large focus on choosing sustainable options. The Global Sustainability Study of 2021 shows that over 30% of Millennials will choose a sustainable alternative when available. Providing an intake and treatment process that fits the digital and more sustainable lifestyle of patients today only serves to bring you and your patients closer together.
