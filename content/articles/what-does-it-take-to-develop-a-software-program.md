desc: What Does It Take To Develop a Software Program? The answer lies in exactly what you want the end product to be. Let’s use Dentech as an example - With 4 decades of experience, we have the most features out of any dental software application on the market to date. Taking all of those features onto a new platform is a time consuming task.

One that we have decided to take on with avengence. How can we deliver a new product to our end users with only half the features that are in our previous releases? This would be a disservice to our end users and definitely not a way to capture a competitive edge in the market.

Take a look at Dentrix Ascend. Henry Schein developed Dentrix Ascend and went to market with only half the features that are in their desktop version. The complaints regarding this are endless. How could such a large corporation not put in the time and effort to build a robust software application when they have the resources to do so? They were more concerned with getting to market and making money than building a customer centric, quality program. That’s why. At Dentech, we chose to do things right.

Every feature that you have come to love and be dependent on is being transferred to our new program design. This is a time consuming task. One that we know will be worth it in the end for our users. Along the way, we are making improvements and adding even more to our program to help you continue to provide best in class care to your patients. If one feature isn’t important to one user how do we know it isn’t important to another customer? Could you imagine if we released our new Dentech without Quick Phone Inquiry or only half of our reports were there? The appointment scheduler without Blue Printing? I do admit though, that the appointment scheduler could use a facelift and we are definitely carving away at a sleek new design for the appointment book that is full of new features and enhancements.

So as you can imagine, transfering 40 years of software to a new design is a massive undertaking. One that we have gladly taken on. We have an outstanding team of in house developers that are working behind the scenes burning the midnight oil working hard to bring you the next greatest Dentech. As we get closer to finalizing screen designs I welcome the opportunity to bring you on board for a sneak peak and to capture your input. Let me know if you are interested in being part of the “Voice of Customer” journey. I know you have a lot to offer because it is customers like you who helped to build such a great product to begin with
