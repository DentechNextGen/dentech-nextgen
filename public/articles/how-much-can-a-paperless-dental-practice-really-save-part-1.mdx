# Long-Term Savings with Equipment Updates

Digitizing your office may seem like both an expensive and frustrating process in the short term, but what about the long-term cost of a paper office?

“Each year, U.S. companies spend over $120 billion on printed forms, most of which become outdated within three months”, according to The Paperless Project. From patient files to mailed invoices, the lifetime cost of paper supplies can really add up. Cutting out printing charts, documents, consent forms, and other hard copies, and moving time-consuming processes like mailing and filing to one-click digital options like Dentech’s practice management software not only reduces the material cost but also the staff costs as well.

Recovering records after an emergency like a fire or flood can be especially costly. Having electronic document management ensures important documents can be updated in a simple, and timely manner while keeping proper accessible backups in case of disaster. Practice management consultant Wendy Aldhamen estimates that dental practices going fully paper-free can save around $10,000 a year through upfront investments in digitizing and choosing more sustainable options. Fully digitizing your files with Dentech’s document management software can get you started on reducing your reliance on paper files while keeping them secure.
