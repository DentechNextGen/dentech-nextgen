desc: 2020 sure has thrown us all for some loops. I think all of us are stepping back and realizing we need to adapt to this new norm we are moving into; Personally, in our business, and our communities.

For Dentech, that means trying new things. We all know the Einstein quote, “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” The past few months, we have been taking a look at that heavily… it is time to try new things.

We have been busy at Dentech behind the scenes working on future technology with a completely redesigned Dentech Practice Management Software. I will admit, it’s daunting. Technology has changed….it continues to change. I find myself swamped in meetings and conferences learning about a new back end system design or feature every other day! I am confident we are making a great new product, but I think it is time to get back to our roots.

Dentech was built with customers like you, helping to make our product exactly what it needs to be. As I embark on this journey, I want to ask for your personal support. I plan to write a biweekly email/blog where I go over what I’ve learned, the development process, where we are going and why… I am sure that you will be able to offer some insight like you have always done in the past.

If you are interested, simply sign up below. It will send me an email! I will read it, and we can get a conversation going. I know you are busy, and you get 1000 interactions per day, I appreciate you taking the time. Join me on this journey, it’s going to be a great experience bringing your voices into the future of Dentech.

Sincerely,

Jane Kaminski
